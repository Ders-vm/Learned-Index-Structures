# Learned-Index-Structures
Prototype of learned index structures in Python, inspired by The Case for Learned Index Structures. Implements recursive model indexes (RMIs) and compares them against traditional B-Trees, with benchmarks on lookup speed, memory use, and accuracy.

## Dataset Information

The project uses synthetic datasets generated by the `DatasetGenerator` class to test and benchmark different index structures. Three types of distributions are supported:

### Dataset Types
- **Sequential**: Ordered numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) representing best-case scenario data
- **Uniform**: Randomly distributed keys across a specified range (0 to 1,000,000)
- **Mixed**: Combination of uniform distribution (40%) with two normal clusters (30% each) to simulate real-world data skew

### Dataset Sizes
Benchmarks are conducted on datasets ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 keys to evaluate performance scalability.
