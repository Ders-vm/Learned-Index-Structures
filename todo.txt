Linear:
    add min/max (adaptive) error window model to compare to hard error Windows
    try searchsorted instead of bisect on both ^ models
    test how long the binary searches are taking
    test how long arranging is taking compared to actually calculating the polyfit
    figure out if memory storage numbers are accurate, if predicition of position is accurate the keys dont need to be stored
