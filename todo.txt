Linear:
    add min/max (adaptive) error window model to compare to hard error Windows (doing currently)
    try searchsorted instead of bisect on both ^ models
    test how long the binary searches are taking when in predicted window
    test how long the binary searches are taking compared to an entire fall back indexwide binary search
    test how long arranging is taking compared to actually calculating the polyfit
    figure out if memory storage numbers are accurate, if predicition of position is accurate do the keys dont need to be stored?
